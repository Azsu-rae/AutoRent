         * Hello,
         *
         * This file serves as a test and a tutorial for using the backend.
         *
         * The backend is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system designed to interact with
         * a SQLite database through Java objects, eliminating the need to write SQL queries manually.
         * It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), which we will explore shortly.
         *
         * Careful reviewing of this file should provide a clear understanding of how to utilize 
         * the ORM effectively.
         *
         * Hope this helps!
         *

        // ------------------- THE CONSTRUCTORS ---------------------------

        // You can, of course, create an object of what table you want. For example:

        Client ilyas = new Client("Ilyas", "Ait-Ameur", "aitameurmedilyas@gmail.com", "0560308452", "DKSF23");

        // creates a client. It is not, however, immediately inputed in the database. For that you'll have to
        // add it using the method:

        boolean success = ilyas.add() >= 1;

        if (success) {
            System.out.println("\nThe object 'ilyas' was successfully inserted in the DB!");
        }

        // And as you can see, the method returns the number affected rows in the operation.
        //
        // Note:
        //  ->  this mehtod will also create the database file and the clients SQLite table automatically.
        //  ->  for the clients SQLite table, all the object's attributes have to be != null in order to
        //      be valid for insertion. Similarily, All models check for validity before insertion.
        //      You can check for validity yourself using 'ilyas.isValid()'.
        //      The method checks wether there are any non-nullable attributes that are, well, null.
        //
        //      In case the tuple is invalid for insertion, the .add() method fails and returns 0.

        // Knowing that memorizing the order of the attributes in a constructor has to be tiring, and
        // in favor of convenience, the setters for each model return the object itself allowing for 
        // method chaining. For example:

        var c = new Client()
            .setName("Hicham")
            .setSurname("Gaceb")
            .setEmail("hichamgaceb@gmail.com")
            .setPhoneNumber("05483729493")
            .setDrivingLicence("KSDU343")
            .add(); // finally adding it to the DB

        // this approach is more readable and should allow the user to create an object without having to
        // write too many 'null' values in a constructor.

        // For tables like vehicles that have non-string attributes,

        Vehicle v = new Vehicle(29.99, "Available", "2024-12-01", 2022, "Toyota", "Corolla", "Sedan", "Gasoline");

        // For tables that have foreign keys, you have to pass the foreing key's java instantiation.
        // if the sent tuples don't have an ID field, the construction will fail and throw an exception.
        //

        // here c and v weren't retrieved from the database and therefore do not have an ID. Thus,
        //
        //          Reservation r = new Reservation(c, v, "2022-01-01", "2022-02-01");
        //
        // will throw an IllegalArgumentException because c and v don't have an ID. If you wish
        // to create objects with tuples make sure you retrieve those from the database.
        //
        // you can check if the tuple is valid and has an ID field using Table.isTuple(<your tuple>)

        // ---------------------- THE SEARCH METHOD -------------------------------------

        // Reading through the models' tables was made as easy as possible. The search methods takes in two
        // kind of arguments:
        //
        //  - A tuple ('tuple' refers to a SQLite table line, but in this case it means a model's instance)
        //  \-> for discrete-valued attributes (like a brand in the case a vehicle or a client's name)
        //
        //  - A range that can be represented in a Pair-type variable.
        //  \-> for continuous-valued attriubtes  (like the price per day of a car or a date range)
        //
        // Both of these can be in vectors when the criterias's values within a same attribute are multiple
        // (for discrete criterias) or when we have multiple range-type attributes
        //
        // The tuples can be stored in any Table-inherited references.

        Vector<Table> clients = Client.search(); // returns all clients (only two at this point)
        print(clients, "Clients");

        // Let's create some vehicles and input them in the DB to see this:
        new Vehicle(35.50, "Rented", "2023-10-15", 2020, "Ford", "Fiesta", "Hatchback", "Diesel").add();

        // returns all vehicles

        // the name of the criteria must be passed to the Pair<> when creating a filter,
        // it has to be the exact same as the class attribute.
        //
        // Passing an incorrect attribute name will throw an exception, so be careful.
        // Of course the range values's type has to be correct. For example
        //
        //              Vehicle.search("year", 2020.0, 2024.0)
        //
        // will throw an exception as 'year' is an integer

        print(bt, "BMWs or Toyotas");

        // NOTE: passing an empty array will throw an exception. If you don't need to filter

        //      or any varient as long as you provide at least one instance of what you are searching for
        //  ->  The name of model to search in (e.g. Table.search("Reservation")) if there are no criterias

        print(maintenancesIn2024, "All 2024 Vehicles Maintenances");

        // But in the case of Reservations, since a reservation's period has two dates, the given range
